	- use the value tag created in VM instance
	- specify IP ranges: (for ex) 0.0.0.0/0
	- specify protocol (tcp, udp, etc) and port
- access VM instance via SSH
	- update packages, clone git
	- change DB_host (in settings.py) by IP of Redis instance
	- change app.run(host='0.0.0.0') (in runserver.py)
	- run cmd: python runserver.py to run the app
	- use IP of VM instance with port (in firewall run) to access the app in browser
- create a Google Storage bucket
- back to SSH shell of VN instance
	- install package: redis-tools
